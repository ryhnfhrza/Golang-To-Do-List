Upcoming feature:

1. Collaborative Tasks:
Feature to add collaborators to a task, where each team member can view, edit, and mark the task as complete.
Implement an access control system, for example, only the creator can delete the task.

2. Subtasks:
Ability to create subtasks under a main task, allowing users to break down work into smaller, more manageable parts.

3. Task Priority:
Add a priority feature to tasks (e.g., low, medium, high) so users can sort or filter tasks by priority.

4. Recurring Tasks:
Feature to create recurring tasks, where users can set tasks to reappear daily, weekly, or monthly.

5. Task Dependencies:
Feature to set dependencies between tasks, for example, task B can only start after task A is completed. This is useful for more complex project management.

6. Tagging and Labels:
Add a tagging or labeling system to categorize tasks. Users can filter and group tasks based on labels.

7. Calendar Integration:
Integration with calendars (e.g., Google Calendar) to view tasks in a calendar format, as well as add or update tasks directly from the calendar.

8. Time Tracking:
Add a feature to track the time spent on each task, allowing users to see how long they have worked on a task.

9. Notifications and Reminders:
In addition to email notifications, add support for SMS or push notifications to ensure users don't miss important tasks.

10. Task History/Log:
Store a history of changes to tasks, such as who changed the status, edited details, or added/removed subtasks.

11. Advanced Search and Filtering:
Users can search tasks based on various criteria such as label, priority, due date, completion status, or even task description content.

12. Archiving Completed Tasks:
Provide a feature to archive tasks that are completed, keeping the task list clean while preserving records of past tasks.
